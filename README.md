## Introduction

This project is an ESP32 project written in C++ and C under the Arduino framework, developed with PlatformIO. It uses the USBHIDMouse and USBHIDKeyboard libraries to simulate mouse and keyboard operations. The project includes four tasks: mouse task, buy task, fire task, and move task. It uses FreeRTOS, a real-time operating system for embedded systems.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project with PlatformIO.
3. Make sure you have installed all necessary libraries (such as USBHIDMouse and USBHIDKeyboard).
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

## Usage

After uploading the code, the ESP32 device will start simulating mouse and keyboard operations. You can adjust the behavior and delay of tasks in the code.
